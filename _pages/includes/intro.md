I am a Master’s student at Wuhan University, supervised by Prof. Yandong Wang. I received my bachelor’s degree from Central South University, where I worked closely with Prof. [Alex Jinpeng Wang](https://fingerrec.github.io/). 

My current research interests lie in synthetic data and data-centric AI, with a particular focus on multimodal and generative AI.
